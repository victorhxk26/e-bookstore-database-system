# E-Bookstore Database System 
The Asia Pacific University (APU) bookstore has an astounding collection of books spanning across a wide range of genres picked from different publishers. As the world swings towards commercial digitalisation, the bookstore would like to begin the quest to grow its business to a new height through the development of an e-bookstore. Therefore, an e-bookstore database management system has been developed using MSSQL to live up to this vision, with hopes that it can streamline the process of organizing and centralizing the increasing, massive volumes of data in the database, which helps to simplify information retrieval processes and boost the performance of the system.
